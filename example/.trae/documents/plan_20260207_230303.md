The compilation error indicates that `KEY_KPLEFTPAREN` and `KEY_KPRIGHTPAREN` are missing from the `wrapper::Keyboard::KeyCode` enum. This is because I copied the `KeyCode` values from `keymap.h` but might have missed some or the original file had them commented out or defined differently.

Looking at the previous `keymap.h` content (from `DeleteFile` or `Read` history):
```cpp
// 0xb0  Keypad 00
// 0xb1  Keypad 000
// 0xb2  Thousands Separator
// 0xb3  Decimal Separator
// 0xb4  Currency Unit
// 0xb5  Currency Sub-unit
#define KEY_KPLEFTPAREN  0xb6  // Keypad (
#define KEY_KPRIGHTPAREN 0xb7  // Keypad )
```
They were defined as macros.

In my `Keyboard::KeyCode` enum in `keyboard.h`:
```cpp
                KEY_NUMLOCK = 0x53, KEY_KPSLASH = 0x54, KEY_KPASTERISK = 0x55, KEY_KPMINUS = 0x56,
                KEY_KPPLUS = 0x57, KEY_KPENTER = 0x58, KEY_KP1 = 0x59, KEY_KP2 = 0x5a,
                KEY_KP3 = 0x5b, KEY_KP4 = 0x5c, KEY_KP5 = 0x5d, KEY_KP6 = 0x5e,
                KEY_KP7 = 0x5f, KEY_KP8 = 0x60, KEY_KP9 = 0x61, KEY_KP0 = 0x62,
                KEY_KPDOT = 0x63,

                KEY_LEFTCTRL = 0xe0, ...
```
I missed `KEY_KPLEFTPAREN` (0xb6) and `KEY_KPRIGHTPAREN` (0xb7) which were between `KEY_KPDOT` (0x63) and `KEY_LEFTCTRL` (0xe0) in the original file (conceptually, though physically separated by comments).

**Plan:**
1.  Add `KEY_KPLEFTPAREN = 0xb6` and `KEY_KPRIGHTPAREN = 0xb7` to `Keyboard::KeyCode` in `keyboard.h`.

I will add them after `KEY_KPDOT`.

Let's modify `keyboard.h`.
