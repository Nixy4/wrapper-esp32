I will modify the `Keyboard` class to internalize the Cardputer-specific data structures (`kXMapChart`, `kKeyValueMap`, `output_list`, `input_list`) since the user stated it is highly bound to the M5Stack Cardputer.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `keyboard.h`**:
    *   Move `kXMapChart` and `kKeyValueMap` definitions/declarations inside the `Keyboard` class (as private static const members) or keep them in the cpp file but private to the class implementation.
    *   Since `kXMapChart` and `kKeyValueMap` are large and specific, keeping them in `.cpp` but possibly as class members or just static data in the translation unit is fine. However, the user asked to "move related data structures to the *class internal*". This usually implies making them `private static const` members of the class.
    *   The `output_list_` and `input_list_` are already members, but currently initialized via `Init`. I should default them to the Cardputer values in the constructor or `Init` without arguments, effectively "binding" it.

2.  **Modify `keyboard.cpp`**:
    *   Initialize `kXMapChart` and `kKeyValueMap` if they become static members.
    *   Hardcode the default pin lists for Cardputer in the constructor or `Init`.
    *   Remove `std::vector<int> inputs, outputs` arguments from `Init` (or make them optional) to simplify usage for the standard Cardputer case.

3.  **Update `app_main.cpp`**:
    *   Simplify `keyboard.Init()` call since it will default to Cardputer pins.

**Specific changes to `keyboard.h`**:
*   Declare `static const KeyChart kXMapChart[7];` inside `Keyboard` class.
*   Declare `static const KeyValue kKeyValueMap[4][14];` inside `Keyboard` class.
*   Change `Init` signature to `void Init();` (no args needed if highly bound).

**Specific changes to `keyboard.cpp`**:
*   Define the static members.
*   In `Init()`, assign the hardcoded Cardputer pins to `input_list_` and `output_list_`.

**Refined Plan:**
1.  Move charts to `Keyboard` class as static const members.
2.  Hardcode pins in `Init` (or Constructor).
3.  Simplify `Init` interface.

Let's do this.
